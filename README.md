# code_snippets

A collection of small code snippets for various usages. Each file can be used separately. These files were written at different stages of my scientific career. It is hard to make them into a single package, especially when it comes to quick distribution. So, I decided to create this repository as a place to keep all these little gadgets.

Even though these scripts/snippets are not intended for general use, if you think some parts might be useful for you, you are more than welcome to use and adopt them. If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message [@Jianhang](mailto:cjhastro@gmail.com?subject=Questions).
